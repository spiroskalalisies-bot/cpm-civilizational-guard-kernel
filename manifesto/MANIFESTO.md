# The CPM Civilizational Guard Kernel

Civilizations collapse when authority can be created silently.

The CPM Guard Kernel is not an AI system.
It is not ethics.
It is not governance policy.

It is an authority firewall.

It enforces that:
- Intelligence is not authority
- Automation is not legitimacy
- Power must be human-caused, traceable, and contestable

Alignment, training, and policy cannot stop authority drift.
Only architecture can.

If a human did not cause it,
it cannot bind.
